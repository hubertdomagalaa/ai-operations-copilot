## Session 10 — 2026-01-27 — Full Dry Run Verification (MILESTONE)

### Completed
- Executed full end-to-end workflow dry run with 3 test scenarios
- All scenarios passed verification:
  - Scenario A (ticket_006): Full flow completed with approval
  - Scenario B (ticket_020): Escalated on low confidence (0.65) + P2 severity
  - Scenario C (incident): Escalated on P1 severity + production outage
- Implemented `triage_node` in `/orchestration/langgraph/nodes.py`
- Fixed `human_review_node` to handle escalation path (no decision_output)
- Fixed `route_after_triage` to check result dict for requires_escalation
- Created mock LLM service at `/tests/mocks/llm_service.py`
- Created dry run test script at `/tests/dry_run_workflow.py`
- Created synthetic incident ticket at `/tests/fixtures/incident_ticket.json`

### What This Proves
- State flows correctly through all nodes
- Routing logic works for both normal and escalation paths
- Agent contracts are honored (schema validation passes)
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints function correctly
- Workflow can pause and resume after approval

### What This Does NOT Prove
- LLM text quality (mock responses used)
- RAG retrieval relevance (no docs indexed yet)
- Production-scale performance

### Definition of Done: VERIFIED
All criteria from the verification plan have been met.

## Session 9 — 2026-01-27 — TriageAgent Implementation

### Completed
- Designed and finalized TriageAgent prompt and schema
- Created `/agents/triage/schema.py`:
  - `TriageOutput`: Main output schema (14 fields)
  - `ConfidenceFactors`: Classification confidence breakdown
  - `TechnicalSignals`: Extracted technical details
  - `TriageReasoning`: Structured reasoning with facts/inferences
- Created `/agents/triage/prompts.py`:
  - Production-ready system prompt with calibration guide
  - User prompt template with ticket JSON injection
  - Prompt versioning for evaluation tracking
- Implemented `/agents/triage/__init__.py`:
  - Full `TriageAgent.process()` method
  - LLM service integration
  - Post-LLM escalation rule enforcement
  - Error handling with escalation fallback

### Key Design Decisions
- Confidence below 0.70 triggers automatic escalation
- secondary_category null in 90% of cases (explicit suppression)
- Incident issue_type always requires human review
- Keyword-based escalation checked post-LLM as safety net

### Remaining for Full Operation
- Implement real LLM provider (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- Test with production traffic
- Collect labeled data for calibration

## Session 8 — 2026-01-25 — Quality Management Infrastructure

### Completed
- Created quality management infrastructure at `/evaluation/quality/`
  - `signals.py`: 12 quality signal definitions
  - `thresholds.py`: Threshold schema (all inactive)
  - `calibration.py`: Calibration pipeline skeleton
  - `regression.py`: Regression detection structures
  - `QUALITY.md`: Documentation explaining the system
- Package `__init__.py` with exports

### What Quality Infrastructure Provides
- Signal definitions: confidence, retrieval, override, latency
- Threshold configuration schema (ThresholdConfig)
- Calibration data structures (CalibrationCurve, etc.)
- Regression comparison structures (RegressionReport, etc.)

### What Remains Intentionally Inactive
- NO thresholds are set (all `is_active=False`)
- NO calibration curves are fitted
- NO regression comparisons are performed
- NO pass/fail decisions are made
- NO automated gating

### Required to Activate Quality Management
1. Collect N > 500 labeled examples
2. Run offline evaluation with evaluators
3. Compute calibration curves with human review
4. Set thresholds with human approval
5. Store evaluation baselines
6. Enable with explicit configuration

## Session 7 — 2026-01-25 — Evaluation Infrastructure

### Completed
- Created offline evaluation infrastructure at `/evaluation/`
  - `datasets/__init__.py`: Dataset schema contracts
  - `runners/__init__.py`: Evaluator interface and runner
  - `reports/__init__.py`: Report generation (JSON, Markdown)
  - `versioning.py`: Version tracking for reproducibility
  - `EVALUATION.md`: Documentation

---

## Session 6 — 2026-01-25 — ActionAgent Implementation

### Completed
- Implemented ActionAgent at `/agents/action/__init__.py`
- Draft response and checklist generation
- Approval validation (safety gate)

---

## Session 5 — 2026-01-24 — DecisionAgent & Human Checkpoint

### Completed
- Implemented DecisionAgent
- Human approval always required

---

## Session 3 — 2024-01-24 — RAG Foundation Implementation

### Completed
- Complete RAG package at `/backend/services/rag/`

---

## Session 2 — 2024-01-24 — LangGraph Workflow

### Completed
- 8 workflow nodes with conditional edges

---

## Session 1 — 2024-01-24 — Initial Bootstrap

### Completed
- Full repository structure

---

## Next Steps

1. Implement real LLM provider (OpenAI or Anthropic)
2. Index knowledge base documents for RAG retrieval
3. Create labeled evaluation datasets (50+ tickets)
4. Add notification service for human review alerts
5. Build simple operator dashboard for approval workflow
