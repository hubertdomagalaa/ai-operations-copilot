## Session 6 — 2026-01-25 — ActionAgent Implementation

### Completed
- Implemented ActionAgent at `/agents/action/__init__.py`
  - Output schema: action_type, content, grounding_sources, confidence, disclaimers
  - Draft response generation (polite, factual, non-committal)
  - Engineer checklist generation (step-by-step, actionable)
  - Approval validation (safety gate)
- Updated action_node in workflow
  - Calls ActionAgent.process()
  - Sets human_approval_status for audit trail
  - Error handling for safety violations

### Guarantees
- ActionAgent NEVER executes external calls
- ActionAgent NEVER modifies systems
- ActionAgent ONLY prepares drafts and checklists
- Approval is VALIDATED before any drafting
- All drafts are marked as requiring human review

### Non-Autonomy Enforcement
- _is_approved() validates human decision
- RuntimeError raised if approval missing
- action_node logs safety violations
- No path exists for autonomous execution

### Known Limitations
- No LLM integration yet (template-based drafting)
- No token usage tracking (TODO)
- No human quality scoring (TODO)

## Session 5 — 2026-01-24 — DecisionAgent & Human Checkpoint

### Completed
- Implemented DecisionAgent at `/agents/decision/__init__.py`
  - Output schema: recommended_action, confidence, risk_flags, requires_human_approval
  - Decision logic combining triage + knowledge signals
  - Risk flag detection (low confidence, no documents, high severity)
  - Human approval always required (safety first)
- Updated decision_node in workflow
- Updated human_review_node as checkpoint
- Extended state schema with human_approval_status

### Guarantees
- DecisionAgent NEVER executes actions
- Human approval is MANDATORY before any action
- All recommendations include risk flags and reasoning

## Session 3 — 2024-01-24 — RAG Foundation Implementation

### Completed
- Created complete RAG package at `/backend/services/rag/`
- Updated KnowledgeAgent with full RAG integration
- Added sample documents at `/data/documents/`

---

## Session 2 — 2024-01-24 — LangGraph Workflow Implementation

### Completed
- Implemented complete LangGraph workflow skeleton
- 8 workflow nodes with conditional edges
- Checkpointing via MemorySaver

---

## Session 1 — 2024-01-24 — Initial Bootstrap

### Completed
- Created full repository structure

---

## Next Steps

1. Implement TriageAgent with LLM classification
2. Add notification service for human review alerts
3. Add evaluation pipeline
4. Integrate LLM for ActionAgent drafting
