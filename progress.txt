## Session 8 — 2026-01-25 — Quality Management Infrastructure

### Completed
- Created quality management infrastructure at `/evaluation/quality/`
  - `signals.py`: 12 quality signal definitions
  - `thresholds.py`: Threshold schema (all inactive)
  - `calibration.py`: Calibration pipeline skeleton
  - `regression.py`: Regression detection structures
  - `QUALITY.md`: Documentation explaining the system
- Package `__init__.py` with exports

### What Quality Infrastructure Provides
- Signal definitions: confidence, retrieval, override, latency
- Threshold configuration schema (ThresholdConfig)
- Calibration data structures (CalibrationCurve, etc.)
- Regression comparison structures (RegressionReport, etc.)

### What Remains Intentionally Inactive
- NO thresholds are set (all `is_active=False`)
- NO calibration curves are fitted
- NO regression comparisons are performed
- NO pass/fail decisions are made
- NO automated gating

### Required to Activate Quality Management
1. Collect N > 500 labeled examples
2. Run offline evaluation with evaluators
3. Compute calibration curves with human review
4. Set thresholds with human approval
5. Store evaluation baselines
6. Enable with explicit configuration

## Session 7 — 2026-01-25 — Evaluation Infrastructure

### Completed
- Created offline evaluation infrastructure at `/evaluation/`
  - `datasets/__init__.py`: Dataset schema contracts
  - `runners/__init__.py`: Evaluator interface and runner
  - `reports/__init__.py`: Report generation (JSON, Markdown)
  - `versioning.py`: Version tracking for reproducibility
  - `EVALUATION.md`: Documentation

## Session 6 — 2026-01-25 — ActionAgent Implementation

### Completed
- Implemented ActionAgent at `/agents/action/__init__.py`
- Draft response and checklist generation
- Approval validation (safety gate)

---

## Session 5 — 2026-01-24 — DecisionAgent & Human Checkpoint

### Completed
- Implemented DecisionAgent
- Human approval always required

---

## Session 3 — 2024-01-24 — RAG Foundation Implementation

### Completed
- Complete RAG package at `/backend/services/rag/`

---

## Session 2 — 2024-01-24 — LangGraph Workflow

### Completed
- 8 workflow nodes with conditional edges

---

## Session 1 — 2024-01-24 — Initial Bootstrap

### Completed
- Full repository structure

## Next Steps

1. Implement TriageAgent with LLM classification
2. Create labeled evaluation datasets
3. Implement evaluator scoring logic
4. Add notification service for human review alerts
