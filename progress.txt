## Session 3 — 2024-01-24 — RAG Foundation Implementation

### Completed
- Created complete RAG package at `/backend/services/rag/`
  - `ingestion.py`: Document loading with metadata preservation
  - `chunking.py`: Fixed-size chunks (512 chars, 64 overlap) with rationale
  - `embeddings.py`: Provider-agnostic interface with local TF-IDF
  - `store.py`: In-memory vector store with cosine similarity
  - `retrieval.py`: RAGPipeline with citation support
- Updated KnowledgeAgent at `/agents/knowledge/__init__.py`
  - Full RAG integration
  - Confidence scoring based on retrieval quality
  - Human review triggers for low confidence
  - Citation formatting for grounding
- Updated knowledge_node in workflow
- Added sample documents at `/data/documents/`
  - api_docs/authentication.md
  - api_docs/user_management.md
  - runbooks/troubleshooting_auth_errors.md

### Design Decisions
- Chunk size 512 chars: Balances precision with context sufficiency
- Chunk overlap 64 chars: Prevents boundary information loss
- Local TF-IDF embeddings: No external dependencies for development
- In-memory store: Simple, fast, replaceable with production store

### Current State
- RAG pipeline is COMPLETE and integrated
- KnowledgeAgent can retrieve grounded context
- Sample documents ready for testing
- No downstream logic depends on unfinished work

### Next Steps (Future Sessions)
1. Implement TriageAgent with LLM classification
2. Implement DecisionAgent with recommendation logic
3. Implement ActionAgent for response drafting
4. Add OpenAI embedding provider
5. Replace in-memory store with persistent store
6. Add RAG evaluation metrics

## Session 2 — 2024-01-24 — LangGraph Workflow Implementation

### Completed
- Implemented complete LangGraph workflow skeleton
- 8 workflow nodes with conditional edges
- Checkpointing via MemorySaver
- Async run_workflow() and resume_workflow()

## Session 1 — 2024-01-24 — Initial Bootstrap

### Completed
- Created full repository structure
- Backend, agents, orchestration scaffolding
- Documentation and configuration files
