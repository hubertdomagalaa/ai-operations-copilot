## Session 1 — 2024-01-24 — Initial Bootstrap

### Completed
- Created full repository structure
- Created backend API skeleton (FastAPI)
  - API routes: tickets, agents, health
  - Core: config, exceptions
  - Schemas: ticket, agent, workflow
  - Services: llm, vector_store abstractions
- Created agent definitions
  - Base agent class
  - Triage agent (classification, prioritization)
  - Knowledge agent (RAG retrieval)
  - Decision agent (action recommendation)
  - Action agent (response drafting)
  - Monitoring agent (system health)
- Created LangGraph orchestration
  - TypedDict state definition
  - Workflow nodes
  - Conditional edge routing
  - Main workflow graph structure
- Created data directories
  - tickets/, documents/, logs/ with READMEs
- Created observability skeleton
  - Distributed tracing framework
  - Metrics collection (counters, gauges, histograms)
- Created evaluation skeleton
  - Evaluators for classification, retrieval, response quality
- Created tests scaffolding
  - pytest configuration with fixtures
  - Unit tests for agents and workflow
  - Integration tests for API
- Created documentation
  - system_overview.md
  - architecture.md
  - agents.md
  - data_flow.md

### Current State
- Repository skeleton is COMPLETE
- All files contain clear docstrings and TODO markers
- No business logic implemented yet
- Ready for implementation phase

### Next Steps (Future Sessions)
1. Install dependencies (langgraph, langchain, fastapi, pydantic)
2. Implement triage agent classification logic
3. Set up vector store for RAG
4. Implement knowledge agent retrieval
5. Implement decision agent with human-in-the-loop
6. Implement action agent response drafting
7. Wire up full workflow
8. Add authentication to API
9. Set up CI/CD
10. Add production logging infrastructure
