## Session 2 — 2024-01-24 — LangGraph Workflow Implementation

### Completed
- Implemented complete LangGraph workflow skeleton in `/orchestration/langgraph/workflow.py`
  - StateGraph construction with explicit typing
  - 8 workflow nodes: triage, knowledge, decision, action, human_review, monitoring, complete, error
  - 3 conditional edge functions for routing decisions
  - Checkpointing support via MemorySaver for human-in-the-loop
  - Async run_workflow() and resume_workflow() entry points
  - get_workflow_status() for querying paused workflows
- Added monitoring_node to `/orchestration/langgraph/nodes.py`
  - Records metrics, logs, evaluation data
  - Runs after action, before complete
- Updated state schema in `/orchestration/langgraph/state.py`
  - Added monitoring_output field
- All workflow files now have executable code (not just TODOs)

### Current State
- LangGraph workflow skeleton is COMPLETE
- Workflow is structurally executable but agents return pass-through state
- Ready for agent implementation (LLM calls, RAG retrieval)

### Workflow Structure
```
START → triage 
           ↓
    [route_after_triage]
           ├── knowledge → decision
           │                   ↓
           │           [route_after_decision]
           │                   ├── action → monitoring → complete → END
           │                   └── human_review
           │                           ↓
           │                   [route_after_human]
           │                           ├── action → monitoring → complete → END
           │                           ├── complete → END
           │                           └── cancel → END
           ├── escalate → human_review → ...
           └── error → END
```

### Next Steps (Future Sessions)
1. Install LangGraph: `pip install langgraph`
2. Implement triage agent with LLM classification
3. Set up vector store for knowledge agent
4. Add structured output parsing
5. Implement human-in-the-loop API endpoints
6. Add proper error handling in nodes

## Session 1 — 2024-01-24 — Initial Bootstrap

### Completed
- Created full repository structure
- Created backend API skeleton (FastAPI)
- Created agent definitions (5 agents)
- Created initial LangGraph skeleton (TODOs only)
- Created observability and evaluation scaffolding
- Created documentation
