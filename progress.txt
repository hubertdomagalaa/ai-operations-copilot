## Session 7 — 2026-01-25 — Evaluation Infrastructure

### Completed
- Created offline evaluation infrastructure at `/evaluation/`
  - `datasets/__init__.py`: Dataset schema contracts (TicketDatasetItem, etc.)
  - `runners/__init__.py`: Evaluator interface and runner orchestration
  - `reports/__init__.py`: Report generation (JSON, Markdown)
  - `versioning.py`: Version tracking for reproducibility
  - `EVALUATION.md`: Documentation explaining the system
- Updated package `__init__.py` with exports

### What Evaluation Infrastructure Provides
- Dataset contracts for labeled tickets, documents, test cases
- Evaluator base class with `.evaluate()` interface
- Placeholder evaluators: TriageAccuracyEvaluator, RetrievalQualityEvaluator, DecisionQualityEvaluator
- EvaluationRunner for orchestrating multiple evaluators
- Report generation with metadata and versioning

### What Cannot Be Evaluated Yet (By Design)
- No real datasets exist
- No scoring logic is implemented
- No thresholds are defined
- No pass/fail determinations

### Required to Activate Evaluation
1. Create labeled datasets in `/evaluation/datasets/`
2. Implement `evaluate()` methods in evaluator classes
3. Define metric thresholds
4. Run evaluations and generate reports

## Session 6 — 2026-01-25 — ActionAgent Implementation

### Completed
- Implemented ActionAgent at `/agents/action/__init__.py`
  - Output schema: action_type, content, grounding_sources, confidence, disclaimers
  - Draft response generation (polite, factual, non-committal)
  - Engineer checklist generation (step-by-step, actionable)
  - Approval validation (safety gate)
- Updated action_node in workflow

### Guarantees
- ActionAgent NEVER executes external calls
- ActionAgent ONLY prepares drafts and checklists
- Approval is VALIDATED before any drafting

## Session 5 — 2026-01-24 — DecisionAgent & Human Checkpoint

### Completed
- Implemented DecisionAgent at `/agents/decision/__init__.py`
- Human approval always required (safety first)
- Updated human_review_node as checkpoint

---

## Session 3 — 2024-01-24 — RAG Foundation Implementation

### Completed
- Created complete RAG package at `/backend/services/rag/`
- Updated KnowledgeAgent with full RAG integration

---

## Session 2 — 2024-01-24 — LangGraph Workflow Implementation

### Completed
- 8 workflow nodes with conditional edges
- Checkpointing via MemorySaver

---

## Session 1 — 2024-01-24 — Initial Bootstrap

### Completed
- Created full repository structure

---

## Next Steps

1. Implement TriageAgent with LLM classification
2. Create labeled evaluation datasets
3. Implement evaluator scoring logic
4. Add notification service for human review alerts
