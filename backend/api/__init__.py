"""
API Package
===========

Contains FastAPI routers and endpoint definitions.

Endpoints are organized by domain:
- /tickets — Ticket ingestion and status queries
- /agents — Agent interaction and workflow triggers
- /health — System health and readiness checks

All endpoints are designed for internal operator use,
not customer-facing interaction.
