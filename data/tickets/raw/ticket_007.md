Description
I have started learning FastApi recently and have been following one youtube tutorial for lessons.

The issue i have been facing with this code is whenever I run delete_post request on Postman I get below error on uvicorn server:
"return Response(status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
TypeError: Response.init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'status_code'"
However, in the instructors video, this is working fine without any errors.

I searched and found few issues related to this on here which I tried to follow but couldn't get myself to resolve the error. I tried following few solutions as provided inside below ISSUE ID but to no avail-
" Response content longer than Content-Length error for DELETE and NoContent #4939"

The two prominent errors I am getting are:

"return Response(status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
TypeError: Response.init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'status_code'
***This is the original code which i am following from the youtube lesson

raise RuntimeError("Response content longer than Content-Length")
RuntimeError: Response content longer than Content-Length
***This is the error i am getting when I try to follow the solution provided in Issue id "4939".

Kindly assist, Thanks!
